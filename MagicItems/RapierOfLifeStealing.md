# Rapier Of Life Stealing

### Description
A long slender rapier made from black steel. Etched into the blade is a lone wolf that never seems to appear in the same place, as if it was stalking along the blade. The pommel is ivory wrapped in black leather with a black steel guard. There is a blood red stone set into the butt of the pommel. When its ability is active, the stone glows with an eerie red light.

### Abilities
When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage, provided that the target isnâ€™t a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt. This effect always goes off on a helpless target.
