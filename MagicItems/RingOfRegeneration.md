# Ring Of Regeneration

### Description
This wooden band looks to be made of dark stained maple. Carved around the outside of the ring is a pattern of vines and leaves, the vines pained a pale green, while the leaves are a vivid forest green. If you study the ring long enough you can see the vines writhe and the leaves rustle slowly along the band.

### Abilities
While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after 1d6+1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
