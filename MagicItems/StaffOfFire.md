# Staff Of Fire

### Description
A tall gnarled oak staff with burned runes running its length. The runes tend to show a pulsing orange glow, and will often emit small bursts of smoke.

### Abilities
You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: burning hands (1 charge), fireball (3 charges), or wall of fire (4 charges). The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
