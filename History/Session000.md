While in Athkatla in the nation of Amn, we (our characters) all separately saw Help Wanted ads for the legendary adventuring company, Acquisitions Incorporated, and we each, for our own reasons, decided to apply. The ads led us to an old tavern, sturdy but unkempt, clearly long abandoned. The place seems to have once been run by the Dauntless Blades, as their promotional material is everywhere. Fortunately, there is also a fireplace and a skulking individual named Dallwort, who seems eager to serve his “masters,” so we should have this place cleaned up in no time.

We briefly became acquainted with each other, a motley crew of adventurers from all walks of life, and we quickly established our various roles within the new franchise, with the Druidic Elven Noblewoman taking charge as our Decisionist.

Looking around our new headquarters, we can see that there is much to be done, and we have a long way to go before we have fully gotten to know each other. Our Decisionist has determined that one of our first items of business should be deciding a name for our franchise, bearing in mind that Acquisitions Incorporated has already supplied us with a logo depicting the central eye of a Beholder. As per our Decisionist’s directions, we are each to submit up to one name suggestion, and the suggestions will be put to a vote once all submissions have been gathered (when we get together next week), so prepare to submit your name suggestion.

As an additional item of business, I, Kharagan of Clan Valonor, have determined to keep role of our franchise. Please inform me (Andrew) of your (character’s) name, background, race, class, and Franchise Position. I will use this information to ensure that you are properly recorded on our roster.
