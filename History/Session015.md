# Session 15
_March 11th 2020_

Congratulations, Eyes of the Beholder! We have successfully completed our first Acquisitions quest (sorta, technically)!

On the morning of the 14th day of our journey to Murann, we left Baba Yaga’s cave with Tyromenator’s scroll in hand. As we traveled down the mountain toward our rendezvous point, a great Green Dragon dropped out of the sky and landed before us, frightening our horses. As Milo calmed the horses, Johannus approached the Dragon, presenting the scroll. The dragon instructed Johannus to set the scroll down, so he did so and then backed away. The dragon bit down at the ground, eating the scroll and a good chunk of dirt, then let out a roar that forced the party to make Wisdom Saving Throws against fear. Most of the party held it together fairly well, but Grixis, fled from the Dragon as fast and as far as he could go, leaving his Staff of Fire behind. As Grixis fled, a humanoid figure clad in green armor descended from the sky, revealing that the Dragon-hunting knight, Tyromenator, who hired us to retrieve the scroll from Baba Yaga, was in fact NOT the same creature as the Dragon we met in the last copse of trees, who had just now eaten said scroll.

Tyromenator told us to quickly hand over the scroll so he could defeat the Green Dragon, but, of course, we no longer had it, so we had to fight the dragon the old-fashioned way. Johannus prepared for the fight by taking cover behind our wagon and making an illusion of himself fleeing, while Milo led the horses to a safe distance. Orel started cast True Strike on the Dragon, and Howard’s Character (who still doesn’t have a name) got ready to charge into melee.

On the first round of combat, Johannus readied a hand crossbow attack against the dragon’s approach, and Tyromenator used a special ability to teleport above the dragon and dropped down onto the dragon, lance first. Milo returned from getting the horses to safety and cast Faerie Fire on the dragon, but the dragon made its Dexterity Saving throw. Even without the aid of Faerie Fire, Howard’s Character managed to hit the dragon with a melee attack, and Orel hit the dragon with Magic Missile, then succeeded his save to shake off his fear of the dragon. At around this time, Grixis’s terror also wore off enough to him to start heading back toward the group. Meanwhile, the dragon flung Tyromenator off his back and used his Poison Breath on the entire party. Tyromenator prevented most of the damage with some magical effect, but everyone in the party still took a considerable amount of damage, and the cloud of poison gas was big enough for Grixis to see his way back.

In the second round, Johannus shot a crossbow bolt at the dragon, which bounced off the dragon’s natural armor, and Tyromenator’s attack also missed. Milo’s second attempt at Faerie Fire failed as well, and Milo used his move to try to get out of range of the dragon’s breath weapon. While the rest of the party was failing with their spells and attacks, Howard’s Character and Orel continued to whittle the dragon’s health down with melee attacks and Magic Missiles. Grixis made his way back to the party, but at the sight of the Dragon, he was again frightened into not being able to approach it, while the dragon bit and clawed at Tyromenator for a great deal of damage.

Tyromenator told Johannus to get the scroll, but Johannus said there was nothing he could do. Tyromenator threw a vial to Johannus, telling him to throw it into the dragon’s mouth, and Johannus, using his Inspiration to stay calm in a stressful situation for the sake of his friends, managed to catch it. Meanwhile, Milo transformed into a Dire Wolf and bit the dragon for minimum damage, Howard’s Character missed, and Orel kept pelting the dragon with never-miss Magic Missiles. Grixis managed to make his way to the Staff of Fire without getting closer to the dragon, but then the dragon beat his wings hard enough to blow everyone back away from it and overturn the wagon.

Johannus and Milo ran back closer to the dragon and took cover behind the overturned wagon, while Tyromenator missed with his attack. Howard’s Character also spent his turn getting back closer to the dragon, while Orel hit the dragon with another wave of Magic Missiles and Grixis hit the dragon (and, accidentally, Tyromenator) with a Fireball. The dragon clawed at Tyromenator again and then hit the wagon with a Tail Swipe attack. The wagon was split in half, and Johannus was hit and knocked prone, but Milo, still in Dire Wolf form, managed to dodge away.

Now up close to the dragon, Johannus threw Tyromenator’s vial into the dragon’s mouth. The dragon convulsed for a moment, and then vomited the entire contents of its stomach onto the ground, including some dirt, half a horse, and, importantly, the scroll, which Tyromenator immediately ran to retrieve. Tyromenator used the scroll on the dragon, but whatever he was trying to do with it, it must have backfired, as the dragon grew even bigger and stronger than he already was. His scales took on a metallic sheen, and a third eye opened in the middle of his head. Now enlightened, the dragon finished off Tyromenator the Dragon Hunter and cast his body aside, then told the rest of us “My fight was not with you. I leave in peace.” The dragon then Ascended, ending to combat.

When we overcame the shock of witnessing a dragon gain enlightenment, we set about the tasks of retrieving the horses, gathering up our scattered supplies, and checking Tyromenator’s corpse for valuables. On his body, we found that his magical armor was completely destroyed, but we still got his magical Lance, an Amulet, and a Bag of Holding containing our payment for delivering the scroll to him, as well as some other treasure, all of which we will Identify next session.

With both the scroll and the payment successfully exchanged, we have technically completed our first Acquisitions Incorporated quest, and we are now one step closer to completing our other two quests of acquiring the Eye of the Serpent for Rand and the Captive Princess for Baba Yaga. Next time, we will Identify our spoils and continue our journey toward Murann and the Serpent’s Eye.
