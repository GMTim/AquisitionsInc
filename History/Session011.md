# Session 11
_November 13 2019_

We’ve got a job! A few days after we saved Athkatla from the necromancer, a tall Elven woman named Rand came into our establishment and hired us to make an Acquisition. The specific item she’s after is the Eye of the Serpent, a magical gem that is rumored to grant the user the ability to control snakes and/or become one. She told us that a Calimshan merchant prince gave the Eye of the Serpent to the last king of Amn in the city of Murann. Some time later, Murann and the surrounding region were taken over by monstrous humanoids who killed the old king. However, the Eye of the Serpent has yet to resurface, so it’s suspected that it’s hidden away in a secret treasure room in Murann. Our job is to find the Eye of the Serpent in the treasure room (or wherever it happens to be) and bring it back to Rand, for which she is paying us 5000GP. One obstacle in our path is the monsters which now control Murann and the region of Amn South of the Small Teeth Mountains, but they have been willing to trade with the Amnians, so perhaps they’re not quite as monstrous as the stereotypes would lead us to believe. 

We spent the session spending the 1000GP Rand paid us in advance to acquire the horses and supplies we’ll need for the journey (mostly thanks to Orel’s incredible bargaining as our Hordesperson), and next session, we’ll set out on our first real Acquisitions Incorporated job!
