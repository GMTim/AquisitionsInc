# Session 12
_January 15th 2020_

It’s been an exciting trip so far! On the first day of our expedition, we saw a large cave bear fighting an elk, but neither creature challenged us, so we decided to pass them by and let nature take its course.

On Day 3 of our journey, Milo saw a pair of griffins flying behind us, clearly eyeing our horses. When they attacked, Grixis hit them with a Fireball, driving one of them away. The other dove at Milo. Milo tried to Entangle the griffin, but it was able to break through and hit Milo, knocking both him and his horse prone and pinning him under his horse. While Galvain, the newly joined fighter, regretted not having packed a bow, Johannus hit the griffin with an arrow, and Grixis finished it off with a second Fireball. The burning griffin fell on Milo and his horse, but the party managed to put the fire out and roll the griffin off of Milo and his horse, and they both lived.

On the night of Day 5, while Johannus was on watch, his well honed senses allowed him to spot a band of bandits surrounding us, moving in for their attack. He awakened the party by shouting and casting Light to illuminate our camp. We roused ourselves as quickly as we could manage as the bandits rushed in. Milo caught one of the bandits with Faerie Fire, a scruffy fellow with an eye patch, then Wildshaped into a Dire Wolf. The bandit with an eyepatch, hit Milo, but not very hard. A bandit who is missing his left hand attacked {Howard’s character}, another fighter who has recently joined the orginization. Grixis jumped up with his dagger at first, but then Firebolted a well-dressed bandit with a beard, and the bearded bandit cast a Firebolt right back at Grixis, proving himself to be a spellcaster. Another bandit, a tall, lanky, bald, serene-looking man in light clothing, also revealed himself to be more than the average bandit by hitting Johannus with a jumping kick attack and another unarmed attack or two. Johannus stabbed the monk-like bandit back, but the bandit seemed to be unusually resilient as well. At tall bandit missed Morel, and a bandit with a mohawk missed Burke. Morel Twincast Firebolt, hitting both the tall bandit and the bandit with the eyepatch. The ugliest bandit hit Galvain, but didn’t do much damage, and Galvain responded by hitting him for maximum damage, which the bandit, surprisingly, survived. Burke hit the mohawk bandit with his vampiric blade and drained some of the life out of him, freaking him out and gaining some temporary HP for himself. And a bandit with good boots hit Grixis.

In the second round of combat, Milo ripped out the eyepatch bandit’s throat, and {Howard’s character} killed the bandit who was missing his left hand. Grixis split a Magic Missile between the bearded bandit and the bandit with good boots, and both of them survived. The bearded bandit, seemingly disappointed with Grixis’s spellcasting, hit both Grixis and Howard’s character with a Lightning Bolt. Grixis was dropped to the ground,  and his ring began pulsing with a glowing, red light, but {Howard’s character} is still on his feet. Johannus hit the monk-like bandit for a significant (though not lethal) amount damage. That’s where we ran out of time and had to end the session.

Next session, we will deal with the six remaining bandits, including the two surprisingly competent ones, and hopefully live long enough to continue on our fledgling franchise’s first expedition.
