# Session 7
_October 09 2019_

Our third month as a franchise is certainly of to a bad start. As I reflect back on my final moments, I wonder if there was anything I could have done differently that might have prevented my death. Going into battle without my armor was certainly unwise, but arriving at the fight ten minutes late is as bad as not arriving at all, though, in hindsight, doing so would have kept me alive. I also should have cast a healing spell on myself while I had the chance, though I’m not sure how much good it would have done. I could have hoped that one of my companions would have healed me, but I will not blame my death on them, and I hope that they don’t blame themselves either. I was foolish, and it is my foolishness that is to blame for my death. My only regret is that I neglected to write those letters I had intended to write and to tell my companions of my past dealings with Rhogar. I had thought that I would have time. But that’s enough about me. I Valonor Kharagon, am dead. Let us focus our thoughts on the living.

The rest of the party survived the fight, but many of them fared nearly as poorly as I did. As one of the tigers was nearly struck down, it warned that it would soon self-destruct, and some of the franchise owners had the good sense to flee to safety. Meanwhile, Thol Deepwood, enraged at my death, used his Staff of Flame to conjure a Fireball that engulfed himself, Orel, Balasar, and several of the remaining tigers, sending all of them to death’s door. Star Moonwhisper finished off the tigers, saved the rest of the owners with Goodberries, and put out the fire with Create Water. One of the few franchise owners to escape the Fireball was Milo Goodbottom, who had seen one of the tigers dive into the portal in our basement and dove in after it. Both Milo and the tiger survived the fall, and Milo finished the tiger off by biting it as a Brown Bear.

The battle is won and done. Now all that remains is to clean up the mess, heal up, and decide what to do next.
