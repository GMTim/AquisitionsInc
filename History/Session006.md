# Session 6
_September 25 2019_

Our third month has begun, and it’s off to a rough start. The extra business we got from curing the rabbity transformations wasn’t enough to make up for the weeks of reduced business we faced while we dealt with the carrot problem. Now that that’s over, many of us are milking what renown we’ve gained for all it’s worth with a new marketing campaign. Hopefully, our marketeering will drum up enough business to put us back in the black.

As Balasar was out around town, he heard that Rhogar, a money-lender, has recently been hiring several non-guild laborers. Meanwhile, several orphanages have closed because all of their orphans have been adopted, mostly by burly, laborious-looking men. At the small price of an arm and a leg, we secured information about several of the adopters, so we’ll soon track them down and potentially find out what Rhogar is up to, assuming the hiring and the adoptions are related.

But first, we have more pressing matters to attend to, namely the mechanical tigers that have broken into our tavern. Some of us were awakened to the sound of someone or something breaking in, and we investigated. We discovered that our tavern was being broken into by five clockwork tigers, and a fight ensued. One of the tigers made its way to our basement, one of them is fighting Milo on the ground floor, and the other three started fighting various franchise owners on the stairs. Star dealt with the tigers on the stairs by casting Thunderwave, throwing all three stair tigers and me, Kharagon, down the stairs, where we landed on Johannus, forming a tangled heap at the base of the stairs.

The battle is ongoing. Once we defeat the mechanical tigers, as I’m confident that we will, we can pursue any of our several leads. We can try to find out where the clockwork animals have been coming from, why they’ve taken an interest in us, and how we can make them stop. We can also track down Rhogar’s laborers and their adopted orphans and try to get to the bottom of whatever his scheme is. And there’s also the matter of Burke’s illusionist friend, who evidently has just about every Illusion spell in her spellbook, which is now in Burke’s possession.

My Lapinthropy is also still a matter of concern, but Reni the Hare has given me a potion which may help me with the affliction in some way. It may even be the same kind of potion that transformed him back when we first met him, but it has yet to be properly Identified, so its true effects remain to be seen. Furthermore, the clerics of Waukeen offer spellcasting services, and their cost of a Remove Curse spell is 100gp. Once I’ve saved up that much money, I will almost certainly be cured. In the meantime, I’ll try not to spread the affliction to others.

We have plenty of work ahead of us. First, we’ll finish off the techno-tigers, and then we’ll deal with one or more of the many other issues we’ve been facing lately.
