# Session 1
_July 24 2019_

The Eyes of the Beholder are almost ready to open! Having decided on a name for our new “francheyes,” we set about hiring people to run the tavern associated with our business. After passing on a limping, middle-aged woman whose only skill had been sailing, we hired Zog Blackblade, a half-orc former farmer eager to get work in the big city, and Godiva Cornwallace, an attractive young human woman who used to be a messenger here in Athkalta.

As our preparations were nearing completion, Godiva accidentally triggered a trapdoor near the fireplace and fell through it. We tied a rope to a beam, and Penub climbed down it into a cellar we didn’t know we had and then even further down into a hole in th cellar floor, through a dark barrier that seems to block all light and sound. On the underside of the barrier, Penub found a large, natural cavern lit by glowing lichen. He found Godiva unharmed, as she had landed on some large mushrooms, but she was unable to climb the rope without help. Penub helped her up to the cellar, but was attacked by a band of pale, dinosaur-like creatures with tiki-style masks. They threw javelins at him, causing him to fall back down to the floor of the cavern. He threatened them in Draconic, and they answered in Draconic by addressing him as “food,” knocking him out, and dragging him off. 

With Godiva safely back in the tavern, muttering something about javelins and Penub possibly being hurt, the rest of the party grabbed their adventuring gear and went down through the cellar to find Penub. What we found at the floor of the tavern was Penub’s javelin, a pool of blood, and the trail of a medium-sized creature being dragged deeper into the cavern. Burke passed on some bardic inspiration, and we all began to follow the trail. Next time, we’ll find out where it leads.
