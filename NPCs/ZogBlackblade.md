# Zog Blackblade

Zog Blackblade was a farmer at the old Blackblade farm in Amn. He decided to leave the farm to seek his fortune in town, and on his first day there found a flyer from [The Eyeâ€™s of the Beholder](../TheEyesOfTheBeholder.md) looking for unskilled workers. Zog applied and was hired.
