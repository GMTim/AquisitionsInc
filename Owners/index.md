### On Extended Leave
_Note_: Acquisitions Incorporated values its employees, and will on occasion allow participating franchise owners take extended leaves of absence. This leave may be granted for any number of personal reasons, and is in no way reflective on Acquisitions Incorporated. Rumors of madness and other work related maladies are unsubstantiated, and will not be tolerated.

### On Extra Extended Leave
_Note_: Death is such an ugly word, we here at Acquisitions Incorporated prefer to see our post mortem employees as assets in the wings. These diamonds in the rough are simply exploring extra planar opportunities, and as their contracts state, are still vary much under obligation to their franchise, and Acquisitions Incorporated.
