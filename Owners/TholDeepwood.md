### Fun Facts:
- Thol, due to his training, has a lingering nightmare where he is giving the most important presentation of his career, and the magic he is using to create an impressive visual display has gone haywire. It now displays an illusory image of him wearing nothing but a strategically placed scarf.
- Thol was trained by the halfling master enchanter [Reni the Hare](../NPCs/ReniTheHare.md). [Reni](../NPCs/ReniTheHare.md) has an odd fondness for carrots, and as an apprentice Thol ate a lot of carrots. He now doesnâ€™t like them much.
