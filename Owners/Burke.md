- Burke has made enemies with a minor nobel named [Biff](../NPCs/Biff.md). [Biff](../NPCs/Biff.md) took on a free lance mission with Acquisitions Inc, and failed to complete it. [Biff](../NPCs/Biff.md) paid Burke to claim it wasn’t his fault the mission went wrong. Burke took the money then threw [Biff](../NPCs/Biff.md) under the carriage. They have been enemies ever since.
